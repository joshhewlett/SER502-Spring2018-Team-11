1.
declaring variables initializing variables assigning variables

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable flag.
Assign the integer number 5.
Assign the boolean flag TRUE.
Assign the boolean flag FALSE.
Assign the integer number 15461.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
flag
number = 5
flag = True
flag = False
number = 15461

2.
initializing variables assigning variables basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Assign the integer number to the value of 1065620.
Assign the integer number to the value of number + 516100.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
number = 1065620
number = number + 516100


3. 
initializing variables if statement basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable second.
Assign the boolean first to the value of FALSE.

Should it be the case first EQUALS FALSE please 
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer second to the value of 4*3+2*3 
otherwise  
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer second to the value of 8/4-4/2+1 Thank you. that is all.
=======

Should it be the case firstvariable EQUALS FALSE 
	please do Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 4*3+2*3 
	otherwise do Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 8/4-4/2+1 
that is all.

Thank you. 
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
second
first = False
if first == False:
	second = 4*3+2*3
else:
	second = 8/4-4/2+1

4.
initializing variables assigning variables while loop basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu,
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer counter to the value of 5.
So long as counter EQUALS 5 please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer counter to the value of counter - 1 
Thank you.
thank you for your iterations.
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

5.
THIS NEEDS REVISIONS TO FOLLOW SYNTAX.

initializing variables, assigning variables, nested commands, basic arithmetic
=======

So long as counter EQUALS 5 
	please do Assign the integer counter to the value of counter - 1 
	thank you for your iterations.
Thank you.

Would you mind doing the following:
So long as flag, please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum * 2 
Assign the boolean flag to the value of FALSE otherwise
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum + 1
Thank you.
