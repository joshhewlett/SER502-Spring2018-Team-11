Should it be the case firstvariable EQUALS FALSE, please 
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 4*3+2*3 
otherwise  
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 8/4-4/2+1 Thank you. that is all.

5.
THIS NEEDS REVISIONS TO FOLLOW SYNTAX.

initializing variables, assigning variables, nested commands, basic arithmetic


Salutations Xiangyu, 

Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable counter.
Create the variable limit.
Create the variable sum.
Create the variable flag.

Assign the integer counter to the value of 1.
Assign the integer limit to the value of 100.
Assign the integer sum to the value of 0.
Assign the boolean flag to the value of TRUE.

So long as NOT counter EQUALS limit , please
Would you mind doing the following:
So long as flag, please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum * 2 
Assign the boolean flag to the value of FALSE otherwise
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum + 1
Thank you.
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal


Questions: 
do we initialize in list? (assign the variable to the value of number) vs command
assign the variable to the value of exp, list commands?
add NOT EQUALS
should we introduce a write expression? we won't be able to see an output else wise.
Please reply with the value of blah
I would like to see the value of blah
etc.
