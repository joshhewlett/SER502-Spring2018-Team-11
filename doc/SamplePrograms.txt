1.
declaring variables initializing variables assigning variables

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable flag.
Assign the integer number 5.
Assign the boolean flag TRUE.
Assign the boolean flag FALSE.
Assign the integer number 15461.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
flag
number = 5
flag = True
flag = False
number = 15461

2.
initializing variables assigning variables basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Assign the integer number to the value of 1065620.
Assign the integer number to the value of number + 516100.

Thank you.

Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
number = 1065620
number = number + 516100


3. 
initializing variables if statement basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable second.
Assign the boolean first to the value of FALSE.

Should it be the case first EQUALS FALSE please 
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer second to the value of 4*3+2*3.
Thank you.
otherwise  
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer second to the value of 8/4-4/2+1.
Thank you. 
that is all.

Thank you. 
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
second
first = False
if first == False:
	second = 4*3+2*3
else:
	second = 8/4-4/2+1

4.
initializing variables assigning variables while loop basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu,

Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer counter to the value of 5.
Thank you.

So long as counter EQUALS 5 please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer counter to the value of counter - 1.
Thank you.
your iterations are appreciated.

Thank you.
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program

counter = 5
while counter == 5:
	counter = counter - 1

5.
initializing variables assigning variables nested commands basic arithmetic


Salutations Xiangyu,
Would you mind doing the following:

Assign the integer counter to the value of 1.
Assign the integer limit to the value of 100.
Assign the integer sum to the value of 0.
Assign the boolean flag to the value of TRUE.

So long as the NOT counter EQUALS limit please
	Would you mind doing the following:
	Should it be the case flag, please
		Would you mind doing the following: 
		Assign the integer sum to the value of sum * 2. 
		Assign the boolean flag to the value of FALSE.
		Thank you.
	otherwise
		Would you mind doing the following: 
		Assign the integer sum to the value of sum + 1.
		Assign the boolean flag to the value of TRUE.
		Thank you.
	that is all.
your iterations are appreciated.

Thank you. 
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal


Sample python program
counter = 1
limit = 100
sum = 0
flag = True
while counter != limit:
	if flag = True:
		sum = sum*2
		flag = False
	else:
		sum = sum+1
		flag = True
