1.
initializing variables assigning variables

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable flag.
Assign the integer number 5.
Assign the boolean flag TRUE.
Assign the boolean flag FALSE.
Assign the integer number 15461.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Thank you.

Thank you. 
>>>>>>> Stashed changes
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

Sample python program
flag
number = 5
flag = True
flag = False
number = 15461

2.
initializing variables assigning variables basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable number.
Assign the integer number to the value of 1065620.
Assign the integer number to the value of number + 516100.

3. 
initializing variables if statement basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu, 
Would you mind doing the following:

Create the variable firstvariable.
Create the variable secondvariable.
Assign the boolean firstvariable to the value of FALSE.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
Should it be the case firstvariable EQUALS FALSE, please 
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 4*3+2*3 
otherwise  
Would you mind doing the following:
Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 8/4-4/2+1 Thank you. that is all.
=======

Should it be the case firstvariable EQUALS FALSE 
	please do Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 4*3+2*3 
	otherwise do Assign the integer secondvariable to the value of 8/4-4/2+1 
that is all.

Thank you.

4.
initializing variables assigning variables while loop basic arithmetic

Salutations Xiangyu,
Would you mind doing the following:
Create the variable counter.
Assign the integer counter to the value of 5.
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
So long as counter EQUALS 5 please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer counter to the value of counter - 1 
Thank you.
thank you for your iterations.
Sincerely, Ajay Bansal

5.
THIS NEEDS REVISIONS TO FOLLOW SYNTAX.

initializing variables, assigning variables, nested commands, basic arithmetic
=======

So long as counter EQUALS 5 
	please do Assign the integer counter to the value of counter - 1 
	thank you for your iterations.

Would you mind doing the following:
So long as flag, please
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum * 2 
Assign the boolean flag to the value of FALSE otherwise
Would you mind doing the following: 
Assign the integer sum to the value of sum + 1
Thank you.
=======
So long as the counter NOT EQUALS limit please do Should it be the case flag 
	please do Assign the integer sum to the value of sum * 2 Assign the boolean flag to the value of FALSE
