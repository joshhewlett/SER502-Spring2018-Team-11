Salutations Xiangyu, 

    Would you mind doing the following:

        Create the variable f.
        Create the variable n.
        Assign the boolean f to the value of 1.
        Assign the boolean f to the value of 0.
        Assign the integer n to the value of 5.
        Assign the integer n to the value of 1.

    Thank you.

Sincerely, Ajay Bansal
